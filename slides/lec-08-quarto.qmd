Q: How do I successfully complete the course?
:::

You successfully complete the course and you  will receive a certificate of completion if you:

[hand in a complete capstone project report that uses a dataset of your choice by 13th February 2024]{.highlight-yellow}

Required items: <https://ds4owd-001.github.io/website/project/>

This is the only requirement to successfully complete the course, independent of how many classes you attended or how many homework assignments you completed.

## Learning Objectives (for this week)

```{r}

# Anatomy of a Quarto document

## Components

1.  Metadata: YAML

2.  Text: Markdown

3.  Code: Executed via `knitr` or `jupyter`

. . .

**Weave it all together**, and you have beautiful, powerful, and useful outputs!

## Literate programming {.smaller}

Literate programming is writing out the program logic in a human language with included (separated by a primitive markup) code snippets and macros.

````         
---
title: "ggplot2 demo"
date: "5/23/2023"
format: html
---

## MPG

There is a relationship between city and highway mileage.

```{{r}}
#| label: fig-mpg

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```
````

# Metadata

## YAML

"Yet Another Markup Language" or "YAML Ain't Markup Language" is used to provide document level metadata.

``` yaml
---
key: value
---
```

## Output options

``` yaml
---
format: something
---
```

. . .

<br>

``` yaml
---
format: html
---
```

``` yaml
---
format: pdf
---
```

``` yaml
---
format: revealjs
---
```

## Output option arguments

Indentation matters!

``` yaml
---
format: 
  html:
    toc: true
    code-fold: true
---
```

## YAML validation {.smaller}

-   Invalid: No space after `:`

``` yaml
---
format:html
---
```

-   Invalid: Read as missing

``` yaml
---
format:
html
---
```

## YAML validation {.smaller}

There are multiple ways of formatting valid YAML:

-   Valid: There's a space after `:`

``` yaml
format: html
```

-   Valid: `format: html` with selections made with proper indentation

``` yaml
format: 
  html:
    toc: true
```

## Quarto linting

Lint, or a linter, is a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs.

<br>

## Quarto YAML Intelligence

RStudio + VSCode provide rich tab-completion - start a word and tab to complete, or <kbd>`Ctrl + space`</kbd> to see all available options.

# Anatomy of a Quarto scholarly article

**Weave it all together**, and you have a beautiful, reproducible journal article!


# Four terms

- Citation
- Reference
- Bibliography
- Citation Style Language (CSL)

## What's a Citation?

::: {.incremental}

- Inequality underpins waste management systems, structuring who can or cannot access services [@kalina2023rich].
- Many visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services [@tilley2021my].
- In @tilley2021my, the authors describe how visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services.

::: 

::: {.notes}
**Explanation**
A citation is a reference to the source of information used in your research. Any time you directly quote, paraphrase, or summarize the essential elements of someone else's idea in your work, an in-text citation should follow. For example, in APA style, a citation might look like this: (Tilley and Kalina, 2021). 

**Analogy**
Think of a citation as a signpost on a road trip. It tells you where the information came from and points you in the direction of the full details (the destination), which can be found in the reference list.

- Many visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services [[@tilley2021my].]{.highlight-yellow}
- In @tilley2021my, the authors describe how visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services.


::: {.callout-important}
## Important: The period is **after** the citation.
:::

## What's a Reference?

- detailed description of the source of information
- author's name, title, year of publication, publisher, DOI, etc.

Tilley, E., & Kalina, M. (2021). “My flight arrives at 5 am, can you pick me up?”: The gatekeeping burden of the african academic. *Journal of African Cultural Studies, 33*(4), 538–548. [https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000493677](https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000493677)

 
::: {.notes}

**Explanation**

A reference is a detailed description of the source of information that you want to give credit to via a citation. In APA style, a reference provides comprehensive details about a source, including the author's name, the title of the source, the year of publication, and the publisher or URL.

**Analogy**

A reference is like a detailed map at the end of your road trip (paper). It provides all the details about the source (destination) that the citation (signpost) pointed to.

::: 

## What's a Bibliography?

::: large

- list of references in a research paper or project
- includes all sources used, whether they were directly quoted or not
- listed alphabetically by the author's last name in the reference list

:::

### References

::: {#refs}
:::

## What's the Citation Style Language (CSL)?

- It's what your citation and generated bibliography look like
- APA (American Psychological Association) Style, Chicago Style, IEEE Style, Vancouver Style, etc. (over 10,000 styles in [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles))

::: {.notes}
The Citation Style Language (CSL) describes the formatting of citations, notes, and bibliographies. It was created to provide an open format that can be used by any application
:::

## What's the Citation Style Language (CSL)?

[author-date:]{.highlight-yellow}  Many visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services [@tilley2021my].

[numeric]{.highlight-yellow}  Many visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services [[1]]().

## Why use a reference management tool?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

Managing references manually:

- is a lot of work 
- is prone to mistakes
- makes you lose track
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

## Why use Zotero?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

- free
- open source: developed in public
- transparent about access to your own data
- cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- collaboration in groups
- integration with word processors

::: {.notes}

**Mendeley**

1. Mendeley is owned by Elsevier. 
2. It encrypts your database and makes money with your data
3. You can only collaborate with 3 people on one project.

**EndNote**

1. EndNote doesn't come free, you need to buy a license. 
2. They also used a prioprietary citation style files that could only be opened by EndNote.

## Scholarly Articles in Quarto

Quarto supports

::: incremental
-   a standardized schema for authors and affiliations that can be expressed once int the source document,

-   the use of Citation Style Language (CSL) to automate the formatting of citations and bibliographies, and

-   outputting to `pdf`, `html`, and `docx` with custom formatting,
:::

. . .

according to the styles required for various journals,

. . .

and creating the LaTeX required for submission to multiple journals.

## Front matter

Quarto provides a rich set of YAML metadata keys to describe the details required in the front matter of scholarly articles. 



::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
-  title
-  author
-  affiliation
-  abstract
-  keywords
-  citation
-  licensing
