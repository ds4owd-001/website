title: "Communication in a chat"
---

Emails are not a very quick, responsive way of communication. We avoid them by prioritising other channels.

We want to communicate through a chat client called Element, providing the open source, free-of-charge Slack-like experience.

On Element, you can reach out to the course instructors and other students any time, and we have a way to stay in touch beyond the course itself. 

To set it up, please follow the steps below:

## Step 1: Join the chat

1.  Download and install Element: <https://element.io/download>. It is available on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.

2.  Open the Element app on your device.

3.  Click **Sign in**

4.  In the Homeserver section, click **Edit**
