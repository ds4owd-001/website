Learners can apply the skills obtained during the course to write a short data analysis project report.\n:::\n\n\n## {{< fa code >}} GitHub repository\n\nEstablishing the GitHub repository with self-identified data was part of the homework assignment of module 5, 6, and 7. \n\n- [Module 5 - Assignment 1](../assignments/md-05/am-05-1-project-data.qmd): Identify data for your capstone project\n- [Module 7 - Assignment 2](../assignments/md-07/am-07-2-project-metadata.qmd): Get going with your capstone project\n\nIt is important that these two assignments are completed before continuing with the write up of the report as outlined on this page. \n\n## {{< fa pen-clip >}} GitHub issue tracker\n\nThe GitHub issue tracker of each student's capstone project repository is used to communicate and ask questions about the Capstone Project report. Each course participant is assigned to one of the course instructors. \n\n## {{< fa calendar-check >}} Submission due date\n\nThe due date for submission of the report is **Tuesday, 13th February 2024**.\n\n## {{< fa list-check >}} Required items\n\n@tbl-required-items is a detailed list of items that need to be included for a complete submission of the capstone project report. Items are categorized into technical, data, and intellectual tasks.
